README for Visualization with Final Findings Section of BUS 446 Final Project

Within this folder, there are two versions of the accompanying presentation to this study: one which is an abridged version which focuses on the findings and visualizations and one with the complete presentation. 
Concerning the former, this slideshow is devised to simply go through the basics of Citi Bike and has a heavy focus on results of the study—which is the third part of the complete presentation. As such, the presentation has the following outline:
•	Explaining the Citi Bike Pricing Model
•	Formulation of the Overall Null and Alternate Hypotheses
•	Examining Distance Disparities
	o	Histograms and Boxplot
	o	Outcomes of the Two Sample T-Test
	o	Rejecting/Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis for This Section
	o	Other Considerations
•	Examining Duration Differences
	o	Histograms and Boxplot
	o	Outcomes of the Two Sample T-Test
	o	Rejecting/Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis for This Section
	o	Other Considerations
•	Examining Station Selection
	o	Histograms and Boxplot
	o	Outcomes of the Chi-Squared Test 
	o	Rejecting/Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis for This Section
	o	Other Considerations
•	Business Recommendations for Citi Bike
	o	A New Citi Bike Pricing Model Based on Business Recommendations

Regarding the latter, numerous slides are duplicated in the presentation. This duplication is intentional to eliminate the need for backtracking during the presentation and to allow for quick reference to past figures. Thus, although the full presentation may be less cohesive as an independent slideshow, it is strategically crafted for a live presentation setting.
