Overview

This repository contains the research paper titled "User Behavior and Citi Bike: A Study of Behavioral Economics and Data Analytics" conducted by Daniel Elmore from Lenoir-Rhyne University. The paper explores the user behavior of Citi Bike, the bike-sharing initiative in the New York metro area, using the lenses of behavioral economics and data analytics.

Paper Abstract

The paper examines the transformative trajectory of Citi Bike since its launch in 2013, analyzing user behavior through behavioral economics and data analytics. The study classifies users into customers and subscribers, proposing an A/B test to discern disparities in biking behavior. The analysis spans from 2016 to 2023, revealing distinctions in trip distance, duration, and station preferences between subscribers and customers. The findings drive strategic business recommendations to refine the payment model, encourage prompt returns, and optimize station distribution.
